# Hackazon construct

## overview

* * *

Please add relevant information about your package.

## tooling

* * *

The targeted audience we are building for is *Windows 10*, *MacOSX*, *ChromeOS*
and *Linux* users. This project uses [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) `0.62.0`
and newer, uses `cpp20` standards for initial implementation of the package. The
objective by far is usability, security, transparency, and lightweight, packages
for any if not most of your application development needs.

## Setup, Compile and Install

* * *

Using this package should be fairly simple just add the git wrap file
in your subprojects directory and include the dependency in your project.

```console
[wrap-git]
directory = hackazon-construct
url = https://github.com/hackazon-modules/construct-cpp.git
revision = main

[provide]
module = hak_dep
```


The next step should be to add the package to your Meson project:

```meson
hak_dep = dependency('hackazon-construct')

executable('prog', 'main.cpp',
    dependencies : [hak_dep])

```

And finally we setup, and compile the project just like normal.

## usage

* * *

Here is a simple sample application that should get you up and
running with using this library as soon as possible but to learn
more please view the API documentation thanks.

**Usage in C++**:

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <hackazon/package.hpp>


//
// main is where all good examples start
//
int main()
{
    std::cout << hak::greet() << std::endl;
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
} // end of function main

```
